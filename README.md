# Algorithm

Algorithm is the heart of problem solving. A good algorithm can solve a problem in a very efficient way. Typically when one's dealing with large amount of data(input), a good algorithm can dramatically save lots of cost(in terms of memory and time resources).

My goal is to explore different kinds of good algorithms for all kinds of different problem sets and try to find out and gather a set of strategy on tackling problem in a "better" way.
